### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Command | Windows/Linux | Mac |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Show History | `Ctrl+Shift+V` | `Cmd+Shift+V` |
| Paste from History | `Ctrl+Alt+V` | `Cmd+Alt+V` |

### Sidebar Panel

1. Click the Clipboard Manager icon in the Activity Bar
2. View all clipboard entries in chronological order
3. Click any entry to copy it to clipboard
4. Use context menu for additional actions:
   - Copy Again
   - Pin/Unpin
   - Delete

### Quick Pick Interface

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+V` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows/Linux)
2. Search through clipboard history
3. Select an entry to copy it
4. Use `Cmd+Alt+V` to paste directly at cursor

## Configuration

Customize the extension via VS Code settings:

```json
{
  // Maximum number of clipboard entries to store
  "clipboardManager.maxHistorySize": 100,
  
  // Show timestamp for each entry
  "clipboardManager.showTimestamp": true,
  
  // Show notifications when clipboard is updated
  "clipboardManager.enableNotifications": false,
  
  // Auto-remove entries older than X days
  "clipboardManager.autoCleanupDays": 7,
  
  // Regex patterns to exclude from history
  "clipboardManager.excludePatterns": [],
  
  // Clipboard monitoring interval (ms)
  "clipboardManager.monitoringInterval": 500,
  
  // Preview length (characters)
  "clipboardManager.previewLength": 50
}
```

### Configuration Examples

**Exclude sensitive data:**
```json
{
  "clipboardManager.excludePatterns": [
    "^password.*",
    ".*secret.*",
    ".*token.*"
  ]
}
```

**Increase history size:**
```json
{
  "clipboardManager.maxHistorySize": 200
}
```

**Enable notifications:**
```json
{
  "clipboardManager.enableNotifications": true
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Monitoring**: The extension polls the clipboard every 500ms (configurable) to detect changes
2. **Storage**: Clipboard entries are stored in VS Code's global state and persist across sessions
3. **Deduplication**: Consecutive identical entries are automatically filtered out
4. **Cleanup**: Old entries are automatically removed based on the `autoCleanupDays` setting
5. **Pinning**: Pinned entries are exempt from size limits and auto-cleanup

## Features in Detail

### Content Type Detection
The extension automatically detects whether copied content is:
- **Code**: Contains programming patterns (functions, imports, brackets, etc.)
- **Text**: Plain text content

### Metadata Tracking
Each clipboard entry includes:
- Unique ID
- Content
- Timestamp
- Pin status
- Source file (when available)
- Line count
- Content type

### Performance
- Minimal memory footprint
- Efficient polling mechanism
- Optimized storage with JSON serialization
- No impact on editor performance

## Troubleshooting

### Clipboard not being monitored
- Check that the extension is activated (look for activation message)
- Verify `monitoringInterval` is not too high
- Restart VS Code

### History not persisting
- Check VS Code's global state storage
- Ensure you have write permissions
- Try clearing history and starting fresh

### Too many/few entries
- Adjust `maxHistorySize` in settings
- Check `autoCleanupDays` setting
- Pin important entries to prevent deletion
